## What is AI? 
Definitions of artificial intelligence vary along two dimensions. The ones on top are concerned with thought processes and reasoning, whereas the ones on the bottom address behavior. Also, the definition on the left measure success in terms of human performance, whereas the ones on the right measure against an ideal concept of intelligece, which we will call rationality. A system is rational if it does the right thing. This gives us four possible goals to pursue in artificial intelligence as follow: 

Systems that think like humans. | Systems that think rationally.
--------------------------------|-------------------------------
**Systems that act like humans.** | **Systems that act rationally.**  

Historically, all four approaches have been followed. As one might expect, a tension exists between approaches centered around humans and approaches centered around rationality. A human-centered approach must be an empirical science, involving hypothesis and experimental cofirmation. A rationalist approach involves a combination of mathematics and engineering. People in each group sometimes cast aspersions on work done in the other groups, but the truth is that each direction has yielded valuable insihts. Let's look at each in more detail.
### Acting humanly: The Turing Test approach
The Turing Test, proposed by Alan Turing (1950), was designed to provide a satisfactory operational definition of intelligence.  Turing defined intelligent behavior as the ability to achieve human-level performance in all cognitive tasks, sufficient to fool an interrogator. Roughly speaking, the test he proposed is that the computer shoud be interrrogated by a human via a teletype, and passes the test if the interrogator cannot tell if there is a computer or human at the other end. For now, programming a computer to pass the test provides plenty to work on. The computer would need to possess the following capabilities:  
* Natural language processing to enable it to communicate successfully in a human language (such as English, Vietnamese,...).  
* Knowledge representation to store information provided before or during the interrogation.
* Automated reasoning to use the stored information to answer questions and to draw new conclusions.
* Machine learning to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns.
